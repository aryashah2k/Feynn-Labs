    "### Automating Helpdesk Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the functions of an IT help desk and how AI can improve service levels and reduce costs. An IT help desk provides a centralized resource to answer questions and troubleshoot problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, an employee or a customer has trouble using the products or services. Say a user is unable to print a Word document. They reach out to a centralized IT help desk either through a phone, email, or chat. Someone from the IT help desk answers questions and help the user resolve his issues. Usually, most user questions are simple, have been experienced in the past, and have ready-made answers. These answers are usually documented in guides or frequently asked questions documents. While answers are easy to find, human assistance is needed to understand the user's questions in their natural language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives like self-help websites require the user to go through a number of, yes/no type questions to find the answers. AI can help here. It can be used to understand the questions asked by the user in natural language and narrow it down to the relevant FAQ articles. In this chapter, I will demonstrate such a use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a very simple approach for this use case for demonstration purposes. We will use a data set that contains a list of FAQ articles and a corresponding set of questions. The FAQ articles can have multiple questions associated with them. We will then build a natural language model that can take a new user question and find the closest question in the dataset. Then, we take the corresponding FAQ article and return it to the user. Next, we will review the techniques that we will be using to build the model."

We can see that the help desk data is correctly loaded. A document in natural processing is considered a collection of words or phrases that are related to a specific entity or topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we consider each question as a document. We need to convert each document into a document vector. A document vector is an array of all the words found in the document. We first need to clean up the questions before this conversion. For this, we first extract the question columns into a document variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "We create a function called process document that will cleanse and pre-process each document. In this function, we first convert all documents into lowercase. Then we remove stop words in the document using the remove stop words function in the NLTK package. We also remove the question mark character. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we split the document into individual words and return it. Now we call the process document function for each question or document in the documents variable. This returns a document vector which gets stored in doc_vectors. We print the second vector in the array and compare it to the original document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run this code now. We can see here how a question like, can Mac Air get infected by a virus, gets cleaned up and split into individual words."

As we can see, each of the unique words in the document vector are listed with a corresponding identifying number. \n",

We print the document and the corpus for the second document in the list to compare the results. As we can see, each word in the document is mapped to a tuple. The first number in the tuple is the word identifier in the dictionary. The second number is the total number of times this word appears in this document. \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, the second array lists the similarity score of the second document with all other documents in this corpus. Its similarity to itself is one. The higher the similarity, the more related these documents are. Now that we have built the similarity index, we can start predicting the question and recommending FAQs."

To find the top matching question, we do an argsort to sort the similarity scores based on the score and return the index of the document in descending order. We print this order. This gives the list of the most matching question to the least matching question. We can then print the similarity score and the corresponding question to check. \n",
